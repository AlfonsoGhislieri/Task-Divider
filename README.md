### Description:

I decided to create an Android Application called "Task Divider" which divides tasks 
for users. This was achieved using Android Studio and Java, I used this as an opportunity to learn a
new language and is the first application I have ever created.

More in depth explanation included in [src folder](https://github.com/AlfonsoGhislieri/Task-Divider/tree/main/app/src/main/java/com/example/afinal).

### TODO:
- Add weight to inputted tasks for better balancing
- Add minimum and max assigned tasks per user depending on total users
