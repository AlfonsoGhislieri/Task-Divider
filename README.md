### Description:

I decided to create an Android Application called "Task Divider" which divides tasks 
for users. This was achieved using Android Studio and Java, I used this as an opportunity to learn a
new language and is the first application I have ever created.

### TODO:
<p>
- Add weight to inputted tasks for better balancing
- Add minimum and max assigned tasks per user depending on total users
</p>
